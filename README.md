NYC non-"A" restaurant finder

This webapp uses NYC open data to construct a database, finding data on all non-"A" restaurants.
It presents the data many different ways, including by zip code, by individual restaurant, by
cuisine, or by violation.  Sinatra is used as the framework and ActiveRecord as the ORM.

Start by typing either ```rackup``` or ```shotgun``` in your console.
