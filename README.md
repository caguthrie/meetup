NYC non-"A" restaurant finder

This webapp uses NYC open data to construct a database, finding data on all non-"A" restaurants.
It presents the data many different ways, including by zip code, by individual restaurant, by
cuisine, or by violation.  Sinatra is used as the framework and ActiveRecord as the ORM.
